## Breaking changes

General note about breaking changes.

**ARM**

| Keyword | Change | Justification | Possible revert |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| Post-index | Post-index memory access has the disponent now set int the `MEMORY` operand! No longer as separated `reg`/`imm` operand. |||
| Sign `mem.disp` | `mem.disp` is now always positive and the `subtracted` flag indicates if it should be subtracted. | It was inconsistent before. | Change behavior in `ARM_set_detail_op_imm()` |
| `ARM_CC` | `ARM_CC` â†’ `ARMCC` and value change | | |
| System registers | System operands separated and in more detail. |||
| System operands | System operands have now the encoding of LLVM (SYSm value mostly) |||
| Instruction enum | Multiple instructions which were only alias were removed from the instruction enum. Exceptions are `POP`, `PUSH`, `VPOP`, `VPUSH` |||
| Instruction groups| Instruction groups, which actually were CU features, were renamed to reflect that. |||
| CPU features | CPU features get checked more strictly (`MCLASS`, `V8` etc.) |||
| `writeback` | `writeback` member was moved to detail. |||
| Register alias | Register alias (`r15 = pc`) are not printed if LLVM doesn't do it. Can be enabled by `CS_OPT_SYNTAX_CS_REG_ALIAS` |||
| Immediate | Immediate values (`arm_op.imm`) type changed to `int64_t` |||

**PPC**


| Keyword | Change | Justification | Possible revert |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| `PPC_BC` | The branch conditions were completely rewritten and save now all detail known about the bits. |||
| Instruction alias | Many instruction alias (e.g. `BF`) were removed from the instruction enum. |||
| Predicates | Predicate enums were renamed for this (values changed as well) |||
| Memory base register | If the base register of a memory operand was r0 it is added again (wasn't present before) |||
| `crx` | `ppc_ops_crx` was removed (because it was never set in the first place). |||


**AArch64**


| Keyword | Change | Justification | Possible revert |
|---------|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| `ARM64` | `ARM64` renamed to `AArch64` everywhere |||
| `SME` operands | `SME` operands contain more detail now and member names are closer to the docs. |||
| System operands | System Operands are separated into different types now. |||
